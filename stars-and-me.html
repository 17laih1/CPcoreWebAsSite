    <h2>Stars and Me</h2>
    <p id="one">Interactions with the stars is like exploring the unknown. My father and I have a tradition to looking into the sky on special occasions, and make a pattern of the stars, some real and some imaginary. He would always say to me "the study of stars are different for each individual."</p>
            
    <p id="two">Named or not, constellations may take many forms, such as mythological creatures, animals, people and object. Most of the time, the name of the constellation is given based on the shape they made to look like with the brightest stars.</p>
            
    <p id="three">My own experience with stars have always been special, because I grew up in a fast-paced city, gazing into a clear sky seemed impossible, but when we hike up the beautiful moutains and stayed until nighttime, it becomes magical.</p>
            
    <p id="four">Stars, in my eyes, are always changing, just like everything else, but I can always make out familiar patterns, no matter where I am, or how far apart from my father I am.</p>
            
    <p id="five">It gives me comfort, to gaze into the sky and know that somewhere around the globe, someone else is doing the same, looking at the same sky I am.</p>
